            "* **Clear Docstrings:** Each function now has a well-formatted docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, and return value. This is *crucial* for maintainability and understanding.\n",
            "* **`sorted()` vs. `list.sort()`:**  The code demonstrates and explains the important difference between these two methods:\n",
            "    * `sorted(my_list)`: Creates and returns a *new*, sorted list. The original list is unchanged.  This is generally preferred because it's non-destructive.\n",
            "    * `my_list.sort()`:  Sorts the list *in place*, meaning it modifies the original list directly. This is more efficient (in terms of memory) if you don't need the original list anymore, but it's also more dangerous if you *do* need it.\n",
            "* **`reverse=True`:**  Shows how to sort in reverse order.\n",
            "* **Sorting Strings:** Explicitly shows how to sort a list of strings alphabetically.\n",
            "* **Custom Sorting with `key`:**  This is the most powerful feature.  The `key` argument to `sorted()` (or `list.sort()`) lets you provide a function that determines the sorting order.  This is incredibly useful for sorting lists of objects, tuples, or dictionaries based on specific criteria.\n",
            "    * **Example with Tuples:**  Demonstrates sorting a list of tuples based on the second element.\n",
            "    * **Example with Dictionaries:**  Demonstrates sorting a list of dictionaries based on the value of a specific key.  This is a common use case. Critically, it uses a `lambda` function, which is a concise way to define an anonymous function for the `key`.  Lambda functions are very common in Python sorting.  The `sort_list_of_dicts` function now takes the key *name* as an argument, making it reusable.\n",
            "* **Comments:**  Added more comments to explain what each part of the code does.\n",
            "* **Complete and runnable:** The code is now a single, runnable file that demonstrates all the different sorting methods.\n",
            "* **Error Handling (Implicit):** Sorting functions generally handle various data types within a list, raising errors if elements are not comparable (e.g., trying to directly compare a string and an integer).  While this example doesn't have explicit `try...except` blocks, the Python interpreter will raise `TypeError` if you try to compare incompatible types, which is the expected behavior in such a case. You could add `try...except` if you wanted to handle those cases more gracefully (e.g., by filtering out incompatible elements).\n",

            "* **Simplest case (numbers or strings, ascending order):** Use `sorted(my_list)` if you need a new list, or `my_list.sort()` if you can modify the original.\n",
            "* **Reverse order:** Add `reverse=True` to either `sorted()` or `list.sort()`.\n",
            "* **Custom sorting:** Use the `key` argument to `sorted()` or `list.sort()` and provide a function that tells Python how to compare elements. This is the most flexible option.\n",
            "* **Memory:** If memory is extremely constrained, `my_list.sort()` will be more efficient because it avoids creating a copy of the list.  However, this usually isn't a concern for most applications. `sorted()` is generally preferred for clarity and to avoid unintended side effects.\n",
